This project was completed as part of coursework for EE40 at the University of California, Berkeley.

“An EEG is a record of the oscillations of brain electric potential recorded from electrodes on the human scalp. The scalp EEG provides very large-scale and robust measures of neocortical dynamic function. A single electrode provides estimates of synaptic action averaged over tissue masses containing between roughly 100 million and 1 billion neurons1. Thus, monitoring EEG signals allow for accurate identification of, among other things: sleep stages, depth of anesthesia, seizures, and other neurological disorders. Other methods reveal robust EEG correlations with cognitive processes associated with mental calculations, working memory, and selective attention. Your project will be focused on detecting the roughly 10Hz alpha waves that are associated with the eyes-closed-waking state (detectable while blinking).”

This project we designed, simulated, manufactured, and soldered a complete EEG on a printed circuit board.
